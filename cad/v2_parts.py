"""v2_parts.py — HOTARU 2.0. v1 is deprecated.

What changed and why, from the printed v1 and the reference mechanism the
user supplied (a Chinese "robot arm 3.18.1" 3MF, measured, plus photos of a
flat-link desk arm):

  pan        v1 had no pan at all; the arm sat on a fixed lid. 2.0 puts a
             MG996R dead centre in the tub, spline up, driving a turntable
             disc. 180 degrees in the plane, 1:1, no gears. The reference
             gears a micro servo into a ring gear because a 9 g servo is
             weak; an MG996R direct-drives the same load and a 180 servo
             through a reduction cannot reach 180 at the table, so its
             gearing is exactly what we do not copy.
  bearing    the disc rides the tub RIM (r72..75), not the servo shaft. The
             one good idea in the reference at our scale: a big slew surface
             takes the arm's tipping moment; the spline only takes torque.
  links      flat sandwich plates with round joint caps, like the reference
             photos, instead of v1's printed tubes. Each link is two plates;
             the next joint's servo body IS the structure between them.
  bed        printed on a P1S: 256 x 256, so the tub, disc and links plate
             together instead of nine A1-mini plates.

Drive interfaces are v1's, unchanged, because they are printed and proven:
cross-recess horn pocket (HORN_*), threaded stub axle + yoke-screw idler
(AXLE_*, SCREW_*), servo tab clamp bars (cup-cap concept). The v1 cone shade
mounts on the head end UNMODIFIED -- the head block copies v1's housing
interface dimensions (H_HX half-width, SG90 spline on axis, AXLE_D stub).
